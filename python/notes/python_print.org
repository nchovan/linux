* how print() works
  print("Python is fun.")
  a = 5
  # Two objects are passed
  print("a =", a)
  b = a
  # Three objects are passed
  print('a =', a, '= b')

  output
  Python is fun.
  a = 5
  a = 5 = b

* print() with seperator and end parameters
  a = 5
  print("a =", a, sep='00000', end='\n\n\n') 	#\n - new line
  print("a =", a, sep='0', end='')   #sep="00000" adds 00000 between the a = and end		
  Output

  a =000005


  a =05

* print() with file parameter
  In Python, you can print objects to the file by specifying the file parameter
  
  sourceFile = open('python.txt', 'w')
  print('Pretty cool, huh!', file = sourceFile)
  sourceFile.close()

  This program tries to open the python.txt in writing mode. If this file doesn't exist, python.txt file is created and opened in writing mode.
