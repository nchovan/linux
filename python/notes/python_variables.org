* 6 types of variables
  integers - whole numbers
  foats  - numbers with decimals
  string - text
  booleans - hold true or false values
  tuples - hold groups of different types of information and cannot be changed
  lists -  hold groups of the same type of date and can be changed at any time.

* assigning variables
  say_hello = "hello world!" 

  number1 = 5
  number 2 = 5
  print (number1+number2)

  the_answer = 6 * 7
  print (the_number)

** assigning new variable
   a = 5
   print (a)
   1 = 10
   print (a)

* comparing variables
  Python also gives you the ability to compare the values of variables and gives you a value of either true or false depending on the comparison

** equal too 
   a = 6
   b = 2 * 3
   print(a == b) # "==" means equal too

   a_string = "Hello"
   another_string = "Hello"
   print(a_string == another_string)

** not equal too
   !=   ex: "Hello" != "Hello!" 

** > (greater than) < (less than)
** >= (greater than or equal) <= (less than or equal)
