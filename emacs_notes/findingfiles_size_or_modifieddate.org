* FINDING FILES BY SIZE:
* size switches for search:
  C for bytes
  W for two-byte words
  K for kilobytes
  M for megabytes
  G for gigabytes
* Find file by size
** Find files bigger than 
  find / -type f -size +1G
  this case files larger than 1 gig
** Find file bigger than (current dir)
   find . -type f -size +1G
** Find files bigger than (specific dir) 
   find Downloads/ -type f -size +1G
** Find files smaller than
   same as greater than just use -
** Find files by size (bigger than)
   find +size 30M
** Find files by size (smaller than)
   same as bigger than just use -
** Find file by size (range from - to +)
   find . -type f -size +10M -size -20M
* Find files by modified date
* common syntaxes
  If you use “-mtime n” it returns a list last modified
  If you use "-atime" it returns a list for accessed files
  If you see "-ctime" it returns a list for changed files

  +n: for greater than n
  -n: for less than n
  n: for exactly n
  See the format below for a better understanding.
* -mtime
  -mtime +10: Use this format, if you want to find a file that was modified 10 days ago.
  -mtime -10: Use this format, if you want to find a file that was modified less than 10 days.
  -mtime 10: Use this format, if you want to find a file that was modified exactly 10 days ago.
** Sort Files and Folders in Reverse Order Based on its Conversion Time
   ls -ltrh path/to/file
** Sort Only Folders in Reverse Order Based on File Conversion Time
   ls -ltrh path/to/file | grep ^d
** Find Only Files That were Modified 120 Days Ago
   find path/to/file -type f -mtime 120 -ls
** Find Only Files That was Modified Less Than 15 Days
   find path/to/file -type f -mtime -15 -ls
** Find Only Files That were Modified Exactly 10 Days Ago
   find path/to/file -type f -mtime 10 -ls
** Find Only Files That Was Modified Less Than 30 Mins
   find path/to/file -type f -mmin -30 -ls
* find any txt file ascessed in the last two days (Documents dir)
  find ~/Documents -iname "*.txt" -atime -2
* find any txt file modified in the last two days (Documents dir)
  find ~/Documents -iname "*.txt" -mtime -2
* find any txt file changed in the last two days (Documents dir)
  find ~/Documents -iname "*.txt" -ctime -2
